# CUDAdrv.jl

Welcome to the API reference documentation of CUDAdrv.jl. This documentation is a work in
progress. For general usage instructions of CUDAdrv.jl and the rest of the Julia CUDA
toolchain, please refer to the [CUDA.jl documentation](https://juliagpu.gitlab.io/CUDA.jl/).

Even though this package is built on the [low-level CUDA driver
API](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-driver-api/), that should not scare you: The wrappers
provided by CUDAdrv.jl are high level, and generally work similar to the higher-level CUDA
runtime API.
